# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
LSTM-based model to predict stock prices using historical data.

This project predicts future stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network on historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- yfinance
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow/keras

## 📊 How It Works
We train an LSTM model on 60-day closing prices of Apple (AAPL) stock to predict the next day’s price.

## 🔮 Output
It shows actual vs. predicted prices on a test set using a line plot.
